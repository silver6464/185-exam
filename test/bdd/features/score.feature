Feature: A scoring application that will record scores given 2 teams in a basketball game.

As a scorer I wish to be able to add scores in a team with scoring 1 pt/2 pts/3 pts
and display the latest scores in a webpage


Scenario:
Given that "team 1" earned 1 point
Then the score on the webpage will be updated with the latest score.
